Project Weave 2.0 builds a framework for applying graph neural networks to startup data to predict its success, which is known as Ventech at Vela Partners. 

Use scripts under  'weave2.0/Scripts'  to experiment with the data. However, in order to access datasets, you will have to request yigit@vela.partners first due to confidentiality. 

Once you have the data, you can run scripts in the order of Data_Preprocessing, graph_analysis, Feature_Engineering, and Training. It will store information into a graph structure and visualise it. Three ML models are respectively applied to this graph for the purpose of node classification. 

You are recommended to read the paper named Vela_GNN_Weave2.pdf first.
